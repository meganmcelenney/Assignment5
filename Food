//  Description: The Food class uses the template the Product class created 
//      to create objects. It has name, damageRate and expirationDate as instance
//      variables along with the ones it inherited from Product. It has its own
//      computeTotalCost and toString methods.

public class Food extends Product
{
    private String name = "?";
    private double damageRate = 0.0;
    private String expirationDate = "08.20.2015";

    public Food(String iden, int numb, double money, String nam, double dam, String day)
    {
        super(iden, numb, money);
        name = nam;
        damageRate = dam;

    public void computeTotalCost( )
    {
        super.totalCost = (unitPrice * quantity) * (1 + damageRate);
    }
