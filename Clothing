//  Description: The Clothing class uses the template the Product class created 
//      to create objects. It has size and color as instance variables along 
//      with the ones it inherited from Product. It has its own computeTotalCost
//      and toString methods.

public class Clothing extends Product
{
    private String size;
    private String color;
    
    //constructor
    public Clothing(String id, int hMany, double price, String sz, String clr)
    {
        super(id, hMany, price);
        size = sz;
        color = clr;
    }
    
    //specific equation for total cost
    public void computeTotalCost()
    {
        super.totalCost = unitPrice * quantity;
    }
    
    //for printing
    public String toString()
    {
        return "\nClothing:" + super.toString() +
                "Size:\t\t\t" + size + "\n" +
                "Color:\t\t\t" + color + "\n";
    }
